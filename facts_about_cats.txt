The cat's clavicle, or collarbone, does not connect with other bones but is buried in the muscles of the shoulder region. This lack of a functioning collarbone allows them to fit through any opening the size of their head.
Purring does not always indicate that a cat is happy and healthy - some cats will purr loudly when they are terrified or in pain.
